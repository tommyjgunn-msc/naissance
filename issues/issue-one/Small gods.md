The god of lost keys lived under Marco's refrigerator. It was a small god, no bigger than a thumb, with skin like tarnished copper and eyes that caught light that wasn't there. Marco had discovered it by accident—reaching under the fridge for a bottle cap his daughter had dropped, his fingers brushing against something warm and impossible.

"Don't tell anyone," the god said. Its voice sounded like coins falling. "They stop believing and we disappear. It's very inconvenient."

Marco, who had spent forty-three years not believing in anything he couldn't hold in his hands, sat back on his heels and considered his options.

"What do you want?" he asked.

The god emerged fully from the shadow, stretching limbs that bent in directions Marco preferred not to examine. "Want? I don't want anything. I just *am*. Lost keys need to go somewhere. I'm the somewhere."

After that, Marco started noticing the others.

The god of almost-sneezes lived in his bathroom cabinet, a wispy thing that smelled like pepper and unfulfilled expectations. The god of songs-you-can't-quite-remember nested in his CD collection, humming melodies that dissolved the moment you tried to listen. The god of words-on-the-tip-of-your-tongue had made a home in his dictionary, though it only came out at night, when the frustration of forgetting grew sharp enough to feed on.

His apartment, it turned out, was full of small gods. Gods of minor inconveniences and tiny mysteries. Gods of the spaces between things—between waking and sleeping, between remembering and forgetting, between the person you meant to call and the person you actually called.

"Were you always here?" he asked the god of lost keys.

"Were you always looking?" it replied.

Marco's daughter visited on Sundays. She was eight, with her mother's eyes and his stubbornness, and she believed in everything with the fierce, uncomplicated faith of childhood.

"There's something under your fridge," she said, lying on the kitchen floor, peering into the darkness.

Marco's heart stopped. "Don't—"

"It's a little man," she said. "He's waving at me."

She waved back.

The god of lost keys emerged, just barely, just enough for her to see. It performed a small bow, antiquated and courtly, like something from a book of manners too old to exist.

"I lost my house key last week," Sofia said, very seriously. "Do you have it?"

The god produced the key from somewhere—its mouth, its hand, the fold of space behind its ear. Sofia accepted it with equal solemnity.

"Thank you," she said.

"You're welcome," said the god.

That night, after Marco had put Sofia to bed in the guest room, he sat on his kitchen floor and watched the small gods emerge. The god of lost keys. The god of almost-sneezes. A dozen others he'd never noticed before—gods of dropped stitches and missed buses, gods of wrong turns and right ones, gods of the pause before someone speaks and the silence after.

They gathered in the kitchen like a congregation, like a family, like the answer to a question he hadn't known he was asking.

"Why can I see you now?" he asked. "Why not before?"

The god of lost keys tilted its head, copper skin catching light from the bulb above the stove. "You stopped looking for big answers," it said. "You made room for small ones."

Marco thought about this. About his divorce, his job, his daughter's eyes. About all the large things he'd lost and all the small things he'd found in their place.

"Is that enough?" he asked.

The gods didn't answer. But they stayed.

And Marco, who had spent forty-three years not believing in anything, discovered that believing in small things was better than believing in nothing.

It was, in fact, almost enough.
