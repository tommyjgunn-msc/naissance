i. before

in the beginning there was sound
without meaning—
wind through acacia trees,
the click of beetle wings,
my mother's breathing
as she walked the long road
from the village to the clinic,
already knowing
she would call me after rain.

ii. the first name

Maji. Water.
Not my name but the thing my name points to—
my grandmother's blessing,
her hand on my mother's belly:
*may she flow where she is needed,
may she find her own level,
may she be the thing
the thirsty cannot live without.*

in Swahili, names are spells.
we don't name children
for who they are—
we name them
for who we hope
they'll become.

iii. the government name

at the registry office
the clerk could not spell Maji.
his pen hesitated over forms
designed for different sounds,
different tongues,
different hopes.

my mother, tired from the birth,
tired from the walk,
tired from the weight of expectation,
said: write whatever you want.

so he wrote: Margaret.
and Margaret I became—
at school, at the bank,
on the passport that lets me
enter countries
that mispronounced my mother.

iv. the nickname

my friends call me M.
one letter, no history,
no expectation.
just a sound,
sharp and short,
like a door closing
or a door opening—
depending on which side
you're standing on.

v. the lover's name

she called me water, too—
but differently.
*you're so fluid,* she said.
*i never know where you end
and i begin.*

i couldn't tell
if it was a complaint
or a confession.

vi. the chosen name

at thirty-three
i went back to the clerk,
to the registry,
to the forms.

i said: my name is Maji.
write it down.

the new clerk, a woman
with my grandmother's hands,
wrote it without hesitation.

*like the river?* she asked.

*like the rain,* i said.

vii. after

my daughter asks me
why her name means storm.
i tell her:
*because you arrived
with thunder,
because you left me
transformed,
because i want you to know
from the beginning
that you have the power
to change everything.*

she says: *that's a lot of pressure, mama.*

i say: *it's not pressure.
it's permission.*

she thinks about this.
then she goes outside
to chase the chickens,
and i watch her—
my storm,
my small weather system,
my proof
that beginnings
are never really beginnings:
they're just the places
where we finally learn
what to call ourselves.
