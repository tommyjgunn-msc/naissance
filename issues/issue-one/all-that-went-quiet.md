When I woke, the first thing I felt was the headache—sharp, pulsing, like someone was driving a nail between my eyes. For a moment, I couldn’t remember my own name, let alone how I’d ended up on the ground. I pushed my palms against the floor. It wasn’t stone, or soil, or anything I recognised. It was firm but slightly uneven, like standing on packed earth that never fully settled. Cold radiated through my skin.

I blinked hard. No improvement. There was no light here, not even the faint blur you get when your eyes are adjusting. Just a uniform dimness, a kind of grey-black space that didn’t seem to come from anywhere or lead to anywhere. I could see only a few feet around me, as though the world was a small circle and everything beyond that was yet to be erected.

The air was still. Heavy. It carried no scent, no warmth, no hint of movement. When I breathed, the sound felt too loud, like my lungs didn’t belong in this place. I tried to stand, but the dizziness hit so hard I had to steady myself with one hand on the floor. My heartbeat thudded inside my skull, throwing my balance off. 

Nothing looked familiar. 

Nothing looked alive.

I was alone, or I thought I was, until I heard the voice.

Close. Low. Calm. Mocking.

“You took your time waking up.”

It came from nowhere, yet it crawled along my spine like ice on fire. A figure emerged from the ink, arriving, as though the shadows had decided to form a shape out of courtesy. 

He wore a suit. Of course he did. Crisp, pressed, immaculate — the kind you wear to a funeral for someone you won’t particularly miss. He carried a book of some sort. The cover was odd, blotched brown, with a texture that looked too organic to be leather. The edges curled slightly, stiff and cracked. It looked suspiciously like…skin. 

“You can call me…” He paused, flicking dust off the cover, “...Arbiter Liminae. Or in simple words, the Adjudicator.”
He offered a thin, bloodless smile. “My predecessors preferred titles like the Senior Arbiter of Transitory Souls or Prince of Darkness. I find them rather…gauche for the modern age. We’ve rebranded since the fire and brimstone era.”

I blinked. “So…you’re the Devil?”

He laughed, a sound like glass breaking underwater. “The Devil? Please. That fiery simpleton deals with the entertaining ones. I’m what comes before. I decide if your soul’s even worth his attention. He only gets the interesting cases. I sort out the mundane.”

I sat up, trying to dust off the nothing that was clinging to me. “And what’s my case file saying?”

“Preliminary review suggests…messy handwriting, questionable ethics, mild delusions of grandeur.” He flipped a few pages. “Oh, and chronic denial.”

“Denial?”


“You’re dead, and you still think this is a dream.”

He wasn’t wrong.

Just then, two doors shimmered into existence behind him, not doors exactly, but thresholds.
 
One glowed faintly, like morning through frost. A breeze whispered through it, carrying laughter, ocean air, and the scent of forgiveness. The other breathed heat. Not fire—something heavier. It exhaled like a furnace that had learned to whisper. Inside, silhouettes moved like smoke trying to escape its own shape. 

The Adjudicator adjusted his tie. “Where do you think you belong?”

I stared at the glowing one. “I think…that one. It just feels right.”
In truth, it felt like grace, maybe, something soft and distant that tugged at me in a way I couldn’t explain. 

He raised an eyebrow. “And why do you think you belong there?”

I smirked. “Let’s be reasonable here. Yes, I’ve done some questionable things, but I try to be decent in the small ways that matter. I’ve given to the poor, helped strangers…I even shared food with my neighbour’s dog once. That alone should put me on some kind of list of saints.”

He blinked. Slowly.

“And,” I continued, “I never waste food. I’ve eaten leftovers that should’ve been declared a biohazard. That’s practically devotion in everyday terms. You’re telling me the cosmos doesn’t reward commitment?”

His expression didn't move, but the air seemed to sigh. “Silence! Your petty good deeds are irrelevant next to the magnitude of your sins.”

“Irrelevant?” I laughed. “I even adopted a rescue cat once. Named her Grace. Irony and compassion, two birds, one halo.”

The Adjudicator snapped the book shut. The sound felt final. “Let’s have a look then.”
The air folded in on itself. A mirror rose before us, not made of glass but of liquid memory. It quivered, waiting.

He gestured toward it with the tired indifference of someone who has done this a thousand times. “Let’s start at the beginning.”


*****

The mirror rippled, and I fell through it, dark as black ink gliding through water. The world around me dissolved. When the shapes settled, I was staring at a small, sunlit room. A bed too big for the boy who slept in it. Curtains the colour of old lemon drops. A toy truck missing a wheel. 

That boy was me. Five, maybe six. The smile on his face had not yet learned the art of hesitation.  His laughter filled the air like warm dust—ordinary, human, alive.

Then came the voices.
“Stop running in the house.”
“Don’t touch that.”
“You’re the eldest now. You have to set an example.”
Each word landed like a commandment carved into soft clay.

I watched as the house grew louder with babies, with crying, with demands. More mouths. More rules. And every new rule came with a new silence.  At first, they only told him to “be mature.”  Then, they told him to stop crying.  Then, they stopped telling him anything at all.

He wet the bed once, just once, and his father’s belt struck his back with sharp, stinging lashes. His mother watched, lips pursed, her eyes avoiding his, her gaze sealed shut. 

On his tenth birthday, there was no party. His mother handed him a stack of his brother’s dirty diapers to take out. “You’re a big boy now,” she said, her smile not quite reaching her eyes. From the living room, he heard the squeals of his younger siblings playing. He stood in the hallway, perfectly still, holding the reeking garbage. He focused on making no sound, casting no shadow, until his own family walked past him as if he were just a piece of furniture. 

There’s something unnatural about watching your own childhood like it’s somebody else’s punishment. Every moment that should’ve been a memory, felt like a verdict.

“Why did they do that?” I asked.

The Adjudicator’s voice came from behind me, steady as ever. “Because they thought they were building a man.”

He stepped closer, his reflection never quite aligning with his body. “They forgot that boys aren't made with hammers.”

I watched the child version of me stare out the window. The world outside was brilliant, a field of light and dust motes and laughter from somewhere else. He pressed his hand against the glass like he could touch freedom through it. The reflection of his hand left a print, and for a moment, I thought I saw it, the faintest shimmer of a boy praying not for toys or friends, but simply to be seen.

He grew quieter, smaller. At twelve, his eyes already looked thirty. At thirteen, they stopped looking at all.

The mirror rippled again. The room vanished, taking its ghosts with it. The Adjudicator didn't speak. He turned a page in his book.

“Next,” he murmured.

And I fell again.

*****

The fall ended in a hallway that smelled of disinfectant and chalk. Lockers lined the walls like iron coffins painted blue. 
I knew this place before I recognised it. The dull hum of fluorescent lights, the way laughter echoed off linoleum like gunfire in a dream, all of it too sharp, too familiar.

I saw him, me, again. Older now. The same hollow eyes, framed by skin too pale from staying indoors too long. He clutched a notebook the way a priest holds scripture. He moved through the crowd, but the crowd never moved around him. They passed through him like smoke through the air.

At lunch, he sat alone, building towers out of crumbs. On the days he tried to speak, his voice cracked like glass left in the sun. The others laughed. The sound was harmless, but it burned anyway.
One girl said, “You’re weird.”
One boy said, “You’re creepy.”
He stopped speaking altogether after that.
It was a quiet death, the kind the world doesn’t laud.

At home, he practised smiling in the mirror. It always looked wrong, like an actor forgetting his lines mid-scene. When he couldn’t sleep, he’d count the cracks in the ceiling instead of sheep. By sixteen, he’d memorised every one. He started writing things down, little thoughts, half-formed. Sentences like:
“If I vanish, will the air close around me like water?”
“If I scream underwater, does it still count as a sound?”

He once brought a razor to his wrist, not for pain, but for proof. He needed to see if he could feel something, anything. But he didn't press down. Not that night. Not yet.

I wanted to look away, but the mirror wouldn’t let me. The Adjudicator was silent beside me, hands folded like a man watching the weather.

When the scene shifted again, it was a graduation. Caps in the air. Faces painted with joy. He stood apart from the crowd, his smile stapled on. When the cameras flashed, he blinked at the wrong moment. Every photo caught him mid-flinch.

“Loneliness,” the Adjudicator finally said, “is the slowest form of decay. You let it cling until it became a part of you.”

He wasn’t wrong.

In the mirror, the boy me turned to the camera, as if he could see us watching. For the briefest second, I thought he did. His eyes met mine—and I swear, he smirked.

Then everything melted away. The smell of chalk became the scent of metal and rain. I could taste adulthood coming, bitter, unripe.

And once more, I fell.

*****

I landed on the scent of rain and old newspapers.
The mirror had brought me to a narrow apartment, beige walls, tired furniture, the hum of fluorescent light struggling to stay alive. A college dorm that wasn’t a dorm; too tidy, too lonely.

The boy, now a man, or something close, was there again. Still me. Still hollow. He sat at his desk, textbooks open but unread, his pen rolling endlessly between shaking fingers. He wasn’t studying anymore; he was performing the act of it, the way an actor keeps repeating the same scene long after the audience has gone home.

The walls seemed to close in with every passing night. His phone lit up occasionally—classmates inviting him somewhere, parties, drinks—but the idea of company terrified him more than solitude ever did.

There were voices in his head now. Not loud ones, just whispers;
“Why are you still here?”
“Does anyone remember your name?”
“Would they notice if you stopped?”


Sometimes, he answered them.
Sometimes, they laughed back.

Then the scene shifted.

It was evening. He stood before a house, familiar and wrong at the same time. The paint peeled like cracked clay. The windows were eyes that refused to blink.

He went inside.

I knew this place too well. The smell hit first, iron and rot and something metallic hiding behind the furniture polish. The living room was a massacre of silence. 

The clock had stopped at 11:17. 
A lamp lay shattered. 
The air was thick with history. 

There was blood on the floor. Not much at first glance, but enough to know that something irreversible had happened. A photo frame lay cracked on the rug, my mother’s face beneath the glass, smiling. My father’s shoes were still by the door, one turned sideways as though he’d stumbled mid-step.

He—I— fell to my knees, hands trembling. His breath came out in broken syllables. He whispered names. He screamed for help.

Neighbours appeared. Police. Questions. Cameras. The news spread like wildfire; tragedy, home invasion, brutal killings. 

He cried on television, pleaded with the public:
“Please. Someone must have seen something. I just want to know who did this. Who did this to my family? Please.”

The Adjudicator watched beside me, unmoved.
His eyes, half-lidded, followed the scene as though reading a report he’d skimmed before.

“Tragic,” he finally said. “How tragedy often finds those who least deserve it.”

But there was something in his tone, something almost amused.

I looked at him. “You think I did it.”

He didn't answer.
Instead, he turned another page in the book.
The sound was heavier this time.

And I felt the world tilt.

The mirror rippled again, and the light drained out of the room until all that remained was the echo of sirens fading into the abyss.

*****

The sound returned first, soft static, like an untuned radio between two worlds. When sight followed, the shapes rearranged themselves into the same room I had just left, but something in the air changed. The dust floated backwards. The blood unstained itself. Time, it seemed, was clearing its throat. 

I stood beside the Adjudicator. His book hung open in his hand, pages fluttering although there was no wind.

“You said you wanted the truth,” he murmured, his voice thin as parchment. “Let’s have a look then.”

The mirror swelled like a lung taking its first breath.

And there I was again, college jacket on, a boy’s exhaustion dressed up as manhood. I pushed open the front door. The sound it made wasn’t that of entry but intrusion. 

“Dad?” I called.
“Mom?”

Silence answered first, then a muffled argument from the kitchen, two voices, sharp and overlapping. My father’s tone was iron; my mother’s was glass about to break. They were fighting about me. I heard “that boy” in his every hiss of breath. My father never acknowledged me as his son. The words “failure” and “disappointment” came like thrown stones.

I stepped inside. The world tilted. The mirror made me watch.

A slap. A shout.
Something inside me split, quietly, like fabric tearing.

I moved before I knew I’d moved. The kitchen knife was there; my hand found it, a reflex born of rage, fear, hunger for sound in a life of silence. 

My father turned, face red, voice rising, and for a heartbeat, I believed I could still step back. Then the blade entered. The moment was almost gentle. He looked at me not in pain, but in recognition, as if he had been expecting it all along. 

Mother screamed. Her hands flew at me, not to stop me, but to erase me, as though I were something she could scrub away. The knife found her, too. Once. Twice. The rest blurred. 

When the noise ended, I was standing in a red room that used to be home. The clock had stopped at 11:17 because I had broken it when I threw it at the wall. 

I tried to rearrange the scene, wipe the blood, fix the faces, make it look like someone else’s crime. The mind invents mercy when the heart is already damned. 

When it ended, I was back in the abyss. 

The Adjudicator was watching me the way a surgeon watches a patient wake mid-operation.
“I…I don’t understand,” I stammered, voice small, almost whimpering. “I just wanted them to love me…I didn’t mean—”

“Didn't mean?” he asked, calm and patient.

He turned the mirror towards me again, but it was empty now. Only my reflection, twitching, cracking around the edges. My head tilted, once, twice, jerky, mechanical. Something in my smile went wrong. 

And then…I saw it. Every memory I had buried, every silence, every shove, every unspoken rule, flashed at me in brutal clarity. A heat rose in my chest, jagged and unyielding. My small voice grew sharp. “They…they made me like this! Every punishment, every word, every command…they built the monster, and now you see it!”

I started laughing for real then. The kind of laughter that tastes like salt and rust.

The Adjudicator’s voice cut through it, calm and final:
“Why did you do it?”

“They deserved it!” I screamed. “They made me this way. They built me out of their silence and called it discipline. They wanted a man, so I gave them one!”

The abyss pulsed, lightless and alive. The Adjudicator closed his book, but he did not speak. The air held its breath.

For a long moment, nothing existed except the sound of my laughter echoing against the walls of nowhere.

Then the echo stopped, because the walls were gone.


*****

Silence had weight now. It pressed on my ribs like stone, made breathing feel like confession. 
The Adjudicator stood with his back to me, hands clasped behind him, the closed book glowing faintly, as though the book itself remembered what it had written.

I could feel my mind unravelling, one thought at a time, threads snapping quietly in the dark. The laughter hadn’t stopped; it had just moved deeper inside, echoing through my skull like a broken bell.

He turned. Slowly.
“You killed them,” he said, but it wasn’t an accusation; it was an observation, the way one might note the weather. 

“I freed them,” I answered. My voice came out wrong, two tones layered on top of each other. “They spent their lives teaching me not to feel, not to cry. I gave them the only lesson they’d understand.”

The Adjudicator tilted his head. The movement was almost…curious. “And do you think that makes you right?”

“I think it makes me seen,” I said. “For once.”

A faint smile, or maybe a crack, appeared across his face. “You talk of being seen while standing in a place where even light refuses to look.”

He opened the book again. Every page was blank.

“Your record,” he said softly, “has written itself out of history. Even damnation has standards.”

He took a step closer. The air between us thinned. “So tell me, little architect of your own ruin…where do you think you belong now?”

The two doors appeared again, the bright one, breathing serenity, and the dark one, humming like a heart too heavy to beat. This time, they flickered, as though even eternity couldn’t decide what to do with me.

I looked at them, then back at him. “You tell me. You’ve been keeping score.”

He said nothing. Instead, the world began to tilt.

The light from the bright door spilt towards me, soft, golden, and for a heartbeat, I almost stepped into it. But then, a whisper rose from the dark one.

My name.

It was spoken by a voice I hadn’t heard since childhood, small, trembling, familiar. My own.

The Adjudicator’s expression changed. He knew what I’d heard.

“You see,” he murmured, “even the Devil has to know who he’s judging.”

He closed the book one last time. The sound rolled through the abyss like thunder that had forgotten how to fade.

“Goodbye, Elias.”

The name hit me, sharp and sudden. All the air rushed from my lungs. My chest tightened, a vise around my heart, and my teeth clenched on the unsaid words that filled my mouth. For a long moment, there was only the metallic taste of shock and the sound of that name echoing in the already empty quiet.

Before I could speak, both doors vanished. The floor cracked open beneath me, and the abyss finally exhaled. I fell, not down, but inward. 

The last thing I saw was the Adjudicator’s face dissolving into the dark, his voice chasing me as I dropped through the nothing:

“Let’s see how deep you go.”

Then—
nothing.

Only the sound of a heartbeat that might have been mine.
