On the weary eye's lift 
Where the moon reigns and oblivion rules
Your arms disowned a palm that held me dearly 
While mine stayed in the air, feeble like a blown thread.


As warmth gave in to the coldness
Ours disappeared like mist, leaving me behind the border
That was once a bridge,  a one way to you;
A home where love once lived.

The curse streaming under my pulse
Love verses were left in the past
Rehearsing elegies, memories rusted 
Diverging melodies led to what it is

White gown hopes dwindled after you
Fake town toasts winded and became new
Brown caches were made blue
Down over a clown seems it's never true

On the dark side of the sky
Where wishes adopt a body, live and majestic,
To turn lemonade into a sour lemon, the night failed not
As I watched a chest that once raced for me dying,
Making beats that no longer intice me.
