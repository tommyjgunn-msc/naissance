The morning my grandmother died, I found a bird in my closet. Not dead—alive, impossibly alive, its small black eyes watching me as I reached for my work blouse. It didn't move. Didn't startle. Just sat there on my shoe rack, between the heels I never wore and the sneakers I wore too often, as if it had always lived there.

I should have been afraid. I should have called someone—my mother, my landlord, the super. Instead, I sat down on the floor across from it and waited.

"You're not supposed to be here," I told it.

The bird tilted its head. In the thin light filtering through the blinds, its feathers shimmered with colors that had no names—not quite purple, not quite green, something older than language.

My phone buzzed. My sister's name on the screen. I already knew what she would say before I answered.

"It's Grandma," she said, and her voice cracked like ice in warm water. "She's gone. This morning. In her sleep."

I looked at the bird. The bird looked at me.

"I know," I said.

Grandmother used to tell me stories about birds. In her village, back home, they believed that when someone died, a bird would come to carry their soul to the next world. Not any bird—a specific one, chosen by the ancestors, painted with the colors of the person's life.

"What color was yours, Grandma?" I asked her once, when I was young enough to believe in magic and old enough to want proof.

She laughed, that deep rumbling laugh that came from somewhere beneath her ribs. "I don't know yet, little one. The bird only shows itself at the end. But I hope it's beautiful. I hope it's strange."

I thought about those stories now, sitting on my closet floor, my sister's grief crackling through the phone line. The bird hadn't moved. It watched me like it was waiting for something.

"Are you here for her?" I whispered.

The bird spread its wings.

The funeral was three days later. I wore the heels I never wore, the ones the bird had perched beside. My mother cried. My aunties sang. My cousins gathered in the kitchen afterward, eating jollof rice and talking about who would inherit the house, the jewelry, the old photograph albums nobody wanted to digitize.

I didn't tell anyone about the bird.

It was still there when I got home—waiting in the closet, patient as prayer. I'd left the window open that morning, half hoping it would leave. It hadn't.

"She's buried now," I told it. "You can go."

The bird hopped onto my palm. Its feet were cold and thin, like twigs in winter. Up close, I could see the details of its feathers—the impossible colors shifting with each breath, each heartbeat. I realized with a start that they weren't just colors. They were images. Memories. My grandmother's hands kneading dough. Her garden in bloom. The scratch of her pen writing letters she never sent.

"Oh," I breathed.

The bird chirped once, soft and knowing.

Then it was gone—not flying away, just gone, dissolved into the air like smoke, like breath, like the last words of a prayer you can't quite remember.

I stood there for a long time, my hand still extended, palm up, carrying the weight of nothing.

Of everything.

Of wings.
