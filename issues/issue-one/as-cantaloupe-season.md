every first week of June, my sister, dad and i go up to my grandfather’s house.

we have gone every year since my parents separated.

every time we go, just before we get to my grandfather’s house, my dad will say, “do you smell that? that – that sweet, beautiful, musky heaviness in the air?” he’d wait for our deadpan responses with bated breath. “that’s because it’s cantaloupe season.” he’ll say it like it is the first time he has ever voiced this riveting piece of information. he always expected us to be falling off our chairs in utter amazement at it. then, my sister would say, “oh, wow, is it?” and not in the sarcastic way Nekesa would have said it, but in a very genuine ‘you are absolutely blowing my mind right now’ way. 

and dad would smile and say, “i know right? isn’t it lovely?”

“very lovely.”

driving up there, dad liked to play old country music. the songs about loves lost and gorgeous women with blonde hair and blue eyes named austin, dad would mostly play if it was late and he was feeling nostalgic as if he too had lost a white texan woman and was currently working out ways to get her back. the ones about gambling and beers and pick-up trucks were played on early mornings because he said they made him think about what was important in life. 

whenever i asked my father why he loved country music so much, he would say that the fact that i even had to ask at all, indicated to him that i did not understand what it meant to be a man. 

my sister would smile every time he said that.

dad liked to drive with his hand hanging out the window so he could shake the ash from his cigarette. he was also a fan of singing very loudly (and very badly) along to the music. my sister liked sitting in the front seat, so she could turn down the volume when he sang too loud, and the combined power of the radio and his singing threatened to cause us permanent ear damage. 

our favorite part was when we’d stop on the way to buy snacks and whenever my sister and i picked something my dad would look at the price, frown deeply and genuinely ask, “okay now what’s that for?”

“i believe it’s a soda dad.”

“you thirsty?”

“so very much. so so very much.”

“Jesus. fine. grab one for Penny too.”

my dad is at his most selfless when someone claims to be needing something ‘so so very much’.

dad is at his most selfless when it comes to her. 

i always got the sense that my dad, along with everyone else in the world, liked my sister more than he liked me.

not in a mean way.

just an objective one.

she was hard not to like.

my sister, she’s tall and sturdy, like a brick building. she played pro basketball in high school. and as she was never one for stories, everything she had to say seemed so important and necessary, that you’d find your ears pricking whenever you heard her voice. i wished the things i had to say mattered like that.

when my sister was sixteen, my grandfather created a makeshift basketball court in his dusty backyard. the hoops, he made from buckets with their bottoms cut out, and the basketball, he bought on one of his few and far between trips to the city. he held it in his shaking, exhausted arms in the rickety bus, the whole way back to his home. it’s old now and we have to keep repumping it whenever we go to visit.

i liked watching my sister play ball. the way she held her braids up in a tight bun, or braided her kinky hair into two tight cornrows with a rattail comb before she started. i liked the way her t-shirts were always bigger than her, how they hung off her shoulders, flattening every curve, dip or steep, how her shorts covered her scabbed knees. i liked how her long fingers with her trimmed nails palmed the ball. i loved how she jumped, how she’d run across the place until she was sweating through her shirt till it clung to her body. i loved the way the ball would follow her, let her take the lead. i loved her. 

dad would challenge her to a game every morning before tea, even though he had bad lungs and couldn't play longer than fifteen minutes without taking a break. 

i’d hear them as i lay in bed, heaving, heavy feet stomping the beaten ground as they chased the ball and laughed, screaming at each other to stop cheating or ‘you can’t run with the ball dad!’ or ‘what the fuck kinda goal is that?’

in those moments, i’d allow myself to pretend that everything was okay and that we were together and that we’d always been that way. we were happy.

sometimes i don’t stop pretending.

she’s four years older than me.

four years older because, twenty-six years ago, my mum and dad had an ugly fight, and my mum left dad for a while and then nine months later my sister was born.

my mum didn’t tell my dad my sister wasn’t his until years later. that was when everything changed, fractured, fell to the ground. he couldn’t look at mum after she told him. even now, he just can’t look at her.

my dad collapsed into himself after that, after they left. he wasn’t talking or eating. 

he was just smoking cigarettes and topping his coffee off with gin. 

my sister called my dad once, three weeks after they’d left, but he was dead asleep on the couch, so i picked it up.

she said, “Penny. are you okay?”

“i . . . yeah, yeah, i’m okay.”

“have you had dinner?”

“um, no, but dad’s ordering in a little bit.”

“oh . . . okay. where's dad anyway?”

“he's asleep. he said he had a long night.”

she sounded skeptical. “okay then.”

“you know dad. he's always tired after work.”

“have you had lunch? are you hungry?”

“i'm okay,” i lied.

“okay . . . just making sure instant noodles aren't the only thing you're having.”

i didn’t answer.

she exhaled. 

“um, Penny, i called because . . . is – is he okay? he hasn’t been answering my calls and i just . . . is he mad at me?”

i didn’t answer truthfully. “no, he’s not mad at you. he’s just busy drinking.”

“every day?”

i didn’t answer. a part of me didn’t want to let her know how bad things were. how maybe i should have just gone with mum when they asked who i wanted to stay with. because mum would cook for me. mum would walk me to the bus stop. mum would check my homework. mum would care. so i didn’t answer.

and she said, “i’m coming over.”

“what?”

“i left a bunch of things behind.”

“no, you didn’t.”

“well you still have my lakers hoodie.”

“no i don’t.”

“Penny.”

“will mum even let you come?”

“ . . . mum’s not home. she’s been gone all week.”

“you’re home all alone?”

“well, mama wambui’s watching me so not really.”

“but mama wambui thinks spongebob is satanic.”

she chuckled. “mickey mouse too. which is why i want to come over. i need a break.”

so she came over.

and she stopped in her tracks at the front door when she saw the state of things. 

how muddy shoes were sprawled at the entrance. how the trash bags were full and dripping rotting food on the kitchen floor. how empty pizza boxes littered the tables. how the dishes were stacked high in the sink. how the empty gilbey’s bottles lay lazily on the floor and tables. how you couldn’t walk an inch without stepping on a cigarette butt. how it smelled like death. how i was just eight and barely able to keep up. how if you took every little thing and added it together, it had begun to equal my father’s life. how my dad was asleep on the couch. 

he was dead asleep on the couch when my sister got there. the electricity tokens were beeping, but he was sleeping right through it. this made my sister scared, or I don’t know, sad? she still wore her clothes big back then, but it was almost like, on seeing everything around us, she grew into them in an instant. she got this look on her face, slid her hairband off her wrist and around her braids, lifted her sleeves and got to work. cleaning every dish in the sink, taking out the trash, throwing away the pizza boxes, wiping down all the surfaces, the floors, picking the mud off the shoes with a stick, she folded the clean clothes and placed all the dirty ones in a pile in the hamper. she wouldn’t let me help her much.

after she was done with all the back breaking work, she taught me how to make the perfect grilled cheese sandwich. she said it was for whenever i was hungry. she was sweating like she would after a long game, kept wiping her brow as she cut the crusts off the bread, buttered the slices, got the cheese out of the fridge, placed the thin slices on the bread and placed the stack gently on a low-simmering pan. 

we ate ravenously. 

dad never woke up in time to order. the couch was dipped from where he slept. my sister couldn’t stop staring at him. we had cleaned but you could still smell the alcohol on him. the cigarettes that stained his breath.

“i need you to call me if you need anything,” she said, picking at her sandwich, not able to look at me.

i chewed slower so i’d be fuller longer. the tokens were still beeping. “. . . but i don’t want you to do all the work.”

“it’s okay. i’m the big sister. it’s what i do.” 

she looked back at dad on the couch. he had started snoring.

“you know . . . you can always come live with me and mum if it gets too hard.”

i shrugged.  “i know but . . . dad’s not that bad. he’s just a little sad . . .” i stared down at my food like i was embarrassed. “dad, he thinks everyone leaves him . . . so i won’t do that. i’ll prove him wrong. i think he just needs a little time. he’ll be okay.”

and my sister smiled at me.

after the meal of sandwiches and cold milk, she tapped my dad on the shoulder, sitting on the table leaning forward with her elbows on her knees, serious expression on her face.

she said, “i’m not going to let you.”

dad was still waking up. “jesus fucking christ,” he said, running his hand over his face.

“i’m not going to let you.”

“when did you even get here?” he sighed and sat up groggily, couch squeaking under his weight. he looked up at her, mad. “and what the hell do you think you're talking about?”


“i’m not going to let you be mad at me.”

“i’m not mad at you.”

“then why don’t you call me back–”

“goddamnit–”

“why don't you care to ask how i am? what i’m doing? if i miss you? if you’re not mad at me, why did you stop being there?”

he couldn’t answer.

“i’m not going to let you not feed Penny. not clean up the house. not make sure she’s okay.” she was crying silent tears and i was too.

1. i thought dad would throw something against the wall.
2. i thought he’d scream at her to leave him the fuck alone, what the fuck did she know?
3. i thought he’d get up and leave and ask her not to let the door hit her on her way out.
4. i thought he’d ask in what world does she think he gives a shit.

but instead he reached his hand out, his face collapsing into a tender frown, placed his hand on her shoulder and pulled her into a hug. and pulled me in too right after. 

he just said, ‘i’m sorry. i’m sorry, baby. i’m sorry,’ over and over again until it seeped into our bones and relaxed our shoulders. until it meant something. until he was our dad again. 

things changed both quickly and slowly after that. i never went to bed hungry and he never missed a prize giving day. and sometimes he’d just walk into my room and watched me do myhomework as he smoked, leaning against the door. 

and then every June we’d drive up to grandpa’s for cantaloupe season.

and my grandfather and i would watch my sister and my dad play ball, watch as they’d pant and laugh and cheer, my grandfather reaching his hand out to place on my shoulder, saying, “go on. join them.”

i’d watch my dad make us his rendition of fruit salad, watch how he held the knife, how every apple slice, every cube of cantaloupe, every segment of tangerine was plump and perfect. watched how he’d slide them all from the chopping block to a bowl and toss them around a little before serving each of us. sprinkling cinnamon and brown sugar on mine and hers. and not on his and grandpa’s.

‘not a nigga alive who could make this salad as well as i do,’ he’d say.

whenever i’d ask my grandfather where he collected my father from, he’d say that it was an honest mistake. that we should not continue to hold it over his head for the rest of his life, he had suffered the consequences quite enough already.

and we’d all fall into the warm lull of laughter, our bellies full and sweet. the country, quiet and far away. my sister smiling and there, my dad joking, my grandfather’s eyes crinkling with love, all of us together and happy . . .

but here’s the thing about cantaloupe season, it always ended and my sister always left. . .again. it was always more about the leaving than the actual being there.  it has always robbed me, in important ways, of something i never really had.
