before the naming, there was only
the long exhale of nothing—

then: a tremor.
a splitting.
the first cell dividing like a promise
it didn't know how to keep.

*

i think about beginnings
the way my mother thinks about god:
with suspicion, with longing,
with the desperate hope
that something this unlikely
might also be this true.

*

in the beginning
was the word, they say—
but what about the silence before?
what about the held breath,
the gathering,
the almost?

*

the seed doesn't know it's a tree.
the egg doesn't know it's a bird.
i didn't know i was my mother's daughter
until i heard her voice
coming from my mouth,
angry and tender
in equal measure.

*

first light:
not the sun itself
but the promise of it.
the edge of dark
learning it has edges.

*

every birth is also a tearing.
every beginning also an end.
the caterpillar doesn't survive
the butterfly.

*

i am trying to say:
there is a violence to becoming.

i am trying to say:
it's the only violence
worth surviving.

*

my daughter asks me
where she was before she was born.
i tell her: everywhere. nowhere.
waiting in the wings.

she says: wings?
i say: it's an expression.
she says: like a bird?
i say: yes. like a bird.

she runs off to play,
and i sit here,
watching the morning
press its face
against the window,

trying to remember
what it felt like
to not yet exist,

to be nothing
but potential,

to be
first light.
