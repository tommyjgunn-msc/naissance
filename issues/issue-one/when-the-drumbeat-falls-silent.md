My grandmother never taught me to swim. This is not unusual—women of her generation, in her village, didn't learn. The river was for washing clothes, for rice paddies, for the men who fished. Water was a tool, not a pleasure. A necessity, not a freedom.

I learned in a suburban pool in California, chlorine burning my eyes, a teenage lifeguard with zinc oxide on his nose blowing a whistle every time I touched the lane dividers. I was seven. My grandmother had been dead for three years.

This is an essay about water. This is an essay about translation. This is an essay about all the things that live between languages, between generations, between the person you were born as and the person you choose to become.

In Mandarin, the word for "swim" is 游泳 (yóu yǒng). The first character contains the radical for water; the second, the radical for eternal. To swim is to move eternally through water. To swim is to make a forever out of motion.

My grandmother spoke a dialect that has no written form. When she died, her language went with her—all those words for specific kinds of rain, for the way light falls through bamboo, for the feeling of missing someone who is standing right beside you. I know these words existed because my mother sometimes uses them by accident, then stops, confused, unable to explain what she meant.

This is how cultures disappear: one forgotten word at a time.

When I was sixteen, I visited the river where my grandmother grew up. It was smaller than I'd imagined—more stream than river, really, barely deep enough to wade. The village was gone, flooded when they built the dam in 1987. The river that remained was a ghost of itself, shallow and slow, running over concrete instead of stone.

I stood at the edge and tried to feel something. Connection. Loss. The weight of history.

I felt nothing but the sun on my neck and the distant sound of a motorcycle.

My mother took a photograph of me there. In it, I am not smiling. I am not sad. I am simply standing, one foot in the water and one on the bank, suspended between worlds.

In graduate school, I wrote my thesis on the untranslatable. All those words that exist in one language but not another: the Portuguese *saudade*, the Japanese *komorebi*, the Welsh *hiraeth*. I argued that these gaps reveal something essential about culture—that what we cannot name, we cannot fully share.

My advisor, an older man who had never left the country, told me the argument was interesting but ultimately solipsistic. "Language is a bridge," he said. "Not a barrier."

I wanted to tell him about my grandmother's dialect. About the river that no longer exists. About all the words I'll never know because the only person who knew them is gone.

Instead, I revised the thesis and graduated with honors.

Here is what the river remembers:

The shape of my grandmother's feet in the mud, age seven, chasing a frog that got away.

The sound of her mother's voice calling her home for dinner, the word for "dinner" something between a command and a song.

The weight of wet cloth, heavy with water and labor, wrung out and hung to dry in the last light of afternoon.

The taste of the water itself—earthy, alive, nothing like the chemical nothing of suburban pools.

The feeling of being small in a world that was still large. Of not knowing that rivers could disappear. That languages could die. That the distance between grandmother and granddaughter could be measured not in miles but in everything that cannot be translated, cannot be recovered, cannot be swum back to no matter how strong you become.

I swim every morning now. Lap after lap in a pool that smells like chlorine and sounds like echoes. I do not think about my grandmother. I do not think about the river. I think only about my breath, my stroke, the eternal motion of moving through water.

But sometimes, when I'm very tired, when the rhythm becomes automatic and my mind goes quiet—sometimes I hear something. A word. A name. Something in a language I don't speak, rising up from the water like a bubble, breaking the surface, and vanishing into air.

I never catch it.

But I keep swimming.
