From the abyss, an echo is heard,
The throbbing hearts of our fathers, long gone.
Kwame Nkrumah aches side to side,
Thomas Sankara’s agony cannot fade,
In desperation, Wangari Maathai masks her pride,
Yet deep within, the anguish rages.
They knew a day like this would come —
When the drumbeats fall silent.

Silent have gone the drumbeats
Visionary men and women of days
Now we preach Singapore with no prospects
Painting hope for success without a process
Acting systematic in broken systems
Hailing development on foreign highways
Yet developed locally for foreign gains!


Where, Africa, did we go wrong?
Ignorance has been our long, tired song.
Our coffee and tea processed in Washington,
Producing tons, receiving a shilling.
We painted beggars with crippled minds.
Unable to stand on our own.

Many a mind blooms in Africa
Yet the talent is sought abroad
Inferiority gnaws on our heads
A better man must speak with an accent
In pursuit of greener pastures
Cows are we who graze and breed!

If only our stomachs were starved,
And our pockets too shallow to be bribed,
If integrity and courage held sway,
Leaders would rise to light our way.
And when the drumbeats fall silent,
A voice will roar through the dark:
Rise, oh Africa.
