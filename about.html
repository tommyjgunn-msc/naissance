      <h2 class="section-title">about us</h2>
      <div class="section-content">
        <p>naissance—from the French word meaning birth or origin—is a literary magazine dedicated to publishing fiction, poetry, and creative nonfiction that captures moments of transformation. We believe in the power of language to illuminate the spaces between what was and what is becoming.</p>
        <p>Founded in 2024, we emerged from a simple conviction: that there are stories waiting in the margins, voices humming beneath the static, narratives that deserve a place to unfold. We are particularly interested in work that challenges conventional forms, that sits comfortably in discomfort, that asks questions it cannot answer.</p>
        <p>We publish quarterly, each issue organized around a loose thematic thread. We pay our contributors, because we believe art is labor and labor deserves compensation. We are committed to amplifying emerging voices alongside established ones, believing that the conversation between generations enriches us all.</p>
